# Roadmap

This repository is me exploring what is possible with a Xamarin Forms `WebView`. I would like to try and achieve the following things in this project:

| Feature                                                      | Complete |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Use Javascript to invoke Xamarin Forms app                   | [X]      |
| Get Javascript invocation working with a local html file     | [X]      |
| Get Javascript invocation working on this GitHub Pages hosted site | [X]      |
| Get Javascript invocation working on an external site (such as Google) | [X]      |
| Create a payload object to pass from javascript to my app that contains plenty of information about the invocation event | [X]      |



## Bonus Points

Here are some extra features I don't think are 100% necessary but would be cool ðŸ˜Ž

| Feature                            | Complete |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Using Typescript instead of JQuery | [X]      |
